                    Hi! My name is Jackson, and I am an Honors Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Theoretical Mathematics undergraduate at THE Ohio State University!
                    This is my portfolio website which contains more information about my professional goals and personal interests, my skills I leverage to achieve said goals,
                    some of the projects I am currently working on and have worked on in the past, and coursework I have completed. There is also a contact form available if
                    you have any questions which you would like to discuss with me!

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As stated above, I am currently working on getting my undergraduate degree (B.S.) in computer science and mathematics at THE Ohio State University, with a planned
                graduation date of May 2026. With this being said, I have learned a great deal from my time completing coursework and conducting research at Ohio State.
                I am incredibly interested and passionate about the analysis of algorithms with regards to machine learning and deep learning, and I would like to help find ways 
                in which we can make artificial intelligence not only more time and resource efficient, but more robust and reliable as a tool people can work with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a deep interest in developing pedagogical methods to streamline education within mathematics, and I hope to start development on projects which 
                will provide more targeted tools to students who may not have access to many resources for learning math in general.
                Some of my other hobbies I enjoy during my free time are weightlifting, trying new and delicious food, running, playing video games, and reading. 
                Feel free to look at some of the projects I have been working on and contact me if you have any questions!
            </p>
